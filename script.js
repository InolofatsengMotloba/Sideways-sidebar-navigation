// Chapter 3 - Exercises

// 1: Minimum -  Define the function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum

// 2: Recursion -  Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.

// 3: Bean counting
// a: Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase B characters there are in the string.

// b: write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase B characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.

  document.body.classList.toggle("dark-theme");
